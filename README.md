## ✨ Hi, I’m @laurabejder ✨

📝 I am a Danish data journalist and current data journalism student at Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. 

💡 I’m interested in politics, political behavior, polling, education, inequality and other social issues. And DATA!

🌱 I’m currently learning python, pandas, scraping, R, HTML and other lovely conding tools for journalistic data analysis!

🌻 This GitHub is a combination of school projects and other things I find interesting! Take a look
